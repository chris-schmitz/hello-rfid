# hello-rfid

A simple hello world I used to start learning RFID.

This is yet another hello-world that I put a bit more effort into than I should have :P

I wanted a way of using RFID to trigger some distinct actions, so the plan was:

-   Make some pokemon figurines with RFID tags embedded into them.
-   Play lights and sounds when the RFID reader detected a specific pokemon.
